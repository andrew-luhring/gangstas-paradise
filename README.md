If this is the best of all possible worlds, this seed / template will include all of the following:


| purpose | framework / language / option |
|  :-------------------------  |  :---------------------------------  |
| server        |  express.js |
| renderer/engine |  express-hbs |
| module format | commonjs + browserify |
| runner | grunt |
| test-runner | mocha* |
| reporter | nyan* ...  don't hate, nyan makes me smile when I'm frustrated. |
| test-runner-runner | karma* |
| assertions | expect |
| fun stuff | angular & jquery |
| styleguide | grunt-styleguide |


*( soon to come )


Right now Mocha and Karma aren't working. BUT I'm close.
